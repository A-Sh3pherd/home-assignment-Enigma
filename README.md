# home-assignment-Enigma

In order to run both the assignments, first make sure you have a database called `test`.

than go to both client/server and run `npm i && npm start`.

once both the server and the client finished installing the dependencies, 
go to url http://localhost:3000
and http://localhost:3000/socket to make sure the sockets works too.

hope you enjoy :)
